# IRVL Bookshelf

As of March 2022, I work at the University of Texas at Dallas as a Student Assistant in the Intelligent Robotics and Vision Laboratory. This lab has passed through a few different hands in the 20 years our building has existed, so our bookshelf (and filing cabinets and such) contain many uncatalogued books, white papers, ungraded schoolwork, computer paraphernalia, etc. It even seems like the contents of older labs migrated to our room, so a large portion of these contents date back to the late 1960s and early 1970s. These were some of the foundational days of (applied) computer science, so I feel a duty to catalogue the contents of our laboratory to preserve history and hopefully reveal items that have been missing from the computer fossil record for the past 30-40 years.
